# Unity Zombie FPS Co-op Singleplayer Edition
Singleplayer version of [Unity Zombie Defence FPS Example](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defense-fps-multiplayer-example).


## Did you already made it?
No, actually that [version](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defence-fps-example) is quite old and outdated.
Multiplayer version was upgraded from that version but now both games have too much different so I couldn't update original singleplayer version.
That's why I made this game, it's modified version of Multiplayer version that can only play Singleplayer.

Not much different, but no more multiplayer related things such as:
- More zombies via player counts
- More bonus cash via player counts
- No Levels and Exp system that actually doesn't needed
- No resurrection
- No inspector(Of course)


## About resources (License)
You can use any script in this game, but don't use blood effect and weapon models.
Blood Effect is sales on Unity Asset Store, and it's not my resource so you could have disadvantage or might be subject to legal regulations.
Weapon models are from [https://www.cgtrader.com/](https://www.cgtrader.com/), I used free models but I'm not sure they can use for commercial purpose.

I'm strongly recommend that just learn how this game works, not gonna use the resources.
I'm not responsible of those personal un-licensed uses!
